# Extension-Methods-for-Unity

Requires Unity 4.5.5 or higher.

Over 800 extension methods for Unity and general C# development. Methods were submitted by the Unity community, gleaned from third party websites, and developed by me during my game development career.

Tested on these platforms: PC, Mac, Android, iOS, WP8, and Web Player. Should work on all Unity supported platforms.

Methods for:
* Targetting
* Layers
* Movement and Rotation
* GameObjects and Components
* Spawning Objects and Prefabs
* Serialization
* Exceptions
* Lists and Arrays
* Cryptography (WP8 safe)
* Numbers and Conversions
* Strings
* Many more!
